# AlphaGAN-Matting
Implementation of AlphaGAN, a Generative adversial method for natural image matting

### Architecture ###

#### Generator ####  
A decoder encoder based architecture is used. This implementation is based on the implementation of Encode decoder architecture used in Deep image matting paper.

#### Discriminator ####
The discriminator used here is the PatchGAN discriminator. The implementation here is inspired from the implementation of CycleGAN 
from

### Results ###

Following are some of the samples generated from this model
