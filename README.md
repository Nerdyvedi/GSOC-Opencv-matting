Progress of alpha matting project

## Alpha Matting

### Description: ### 
    Project aims at generating a large training dataset for alpha matting, training the model and converting the model to ONNX to  
    be used with OpenCV's DNN module and to integrate some of the best computer vision based best alpha matting algorithms into 
    OpenCV.

### Expected Outcomes:
   
  1.    A large dataset which can be used to train models of alpha matting.
   
  2.    Implement the paper: "AlphaGAN Matting" by Sebastian Lultz.
        
  3.    Trained model by the use of the generated dataset
        
  4.    Convert model to ONNX and provide a running example in OpenCV's DNN module
  
  5.    Implement the paper: "A Global Sampling Method for Alpha Matting" by Kaiming He et al.
        Implement the paper: "Designing Effective Inter-Pixel Information Flow for Natural Image Matting" by Yagiz et. al."
        
  6.    Experiments comparing results to existing alpha matting algorithms at alphamatting.com    
    
 ### Resources
